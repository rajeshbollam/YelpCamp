## Key Learnings and Technologies
- **MVC Architecture**: Utilized to ensure separation of concerns across backend and frontend, enhancing maintainability.
- **Express.js**: A streamlined backend framework that minimizes server-side boilerplate, ideal for modular development.
- **Express-Session**: Applied to understand and implement cookie-based sessions for an enriched user experience.
- **Passport.js**: Integrated for robust user authentication and authorization.
- **MongoDB**: Chosen as the primary database to store data on campgrounds, users, reviews, and sessions.
- **Mongoose**: Used as an ORM to facilitate database interactions.
- **Cloudinary**: Employed to manage campground images, ensuring efficient storage and optimization.
- **Mapbox**: Provides interactive maps to visually represent campground locations.
- **EJS**: Selected as the templating engine to build dynamic views.
- **Bootstrap**: The cornerstone CSS framework for crafting visually appealing interfaces.
- **Render**: Chosen to host the entire application, offering a reliable and scalable deployment solution.


## Roadmap

### Refactor Backend
- **Transition to TypeScript**: Enhance code type safety by migrating the existing JavaScript backend to TypeScript.

### Frontend Overhaul
- **Adopt Next.js**: Replace EJS templates with Next.js to utilize the scalability and modularity of React while still benefiting from server-side rendering.

### UI Enhancements
- **Integrate Three.js**: Enhance the user interface by incorporating Three.js for a more dynamic and interactive visual experience.
